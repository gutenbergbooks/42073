<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The Electric Light possesses the great advantage
over gas, in that it can be turned on
or lighted from a distance. The customary
means of igniting gas with a match or taper is
both dangerous and often inconvenient. The
inventive genius of modern times has evolved
a means of lighting gas by electricity
which is both reliable and easy of application.
It requires no very complicated devices,
nor does it necessitate a deep knowledge
of electrical matters for its installation.
The object of the following pages is to enable
any one possessing ordinary mechanical ability
to construct much of the apparatus used, or at
least to successfully erect it and keep it in
operation.</p>

<p>We beg to thank the following firms for the
use of illustrations: Edwards &amp; Co., Mott Haven,
New York; A. L. Bogart, New York;

Co., Boston, Mass., and The Manhattan

</small>
</h2>

<p>The enormous number of fires arising from
the use of matches, and the great convenience
and freedom from danger of the
electric method of gas lighting, are alone sufficient
reasons for the issue of these pages.</p>

<p>The veriest tyro in electrical operations
knows that electricity will cause a spark, and
most persons are aware that the spark possesses
considerable deflagratory powers, varying
with the character of the spark. In electric
gas lighting a spark of the proper character
is passed across a jet of gas and ignites it.
Sparks can be produced by various means:
friction, battery current, induction either galvanic
or electro-magnetic, by a Wimshurst or
Toepler Holtz machine, or an induction coil
operated by a battery. For our purposes we
will consider only the latter; the former are
rarely used, being uncertain and unwieldy.</p>

<p>Of batteries there are many kinds, and although<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
all will produce sparks, yet for electric
gas lighting those made for intermittent work
and classed as open circuit cells are to be preferred.
Open circuit batteries, which will be
fully described in a subsequent chapter, include
the Leclanche, and most of the so-called
&ldquo;dry&rdquo; cells.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig1-2-3" src="images/fig1-2-3.jpg" width="329" height="218" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 1., Fig. 2., &amp; Fig. 3.</p>
</div>

<p>If two wires be attached to a cell of battery
<em>B</em>, one to the carbon or positive pole and
the other to the zinc or negative pole,
and their free ends be tapped together, minute
sparks at <em>C</em> will be observed each time the
wires <em>separate</em> (Fig. 1). If now a coil of insulated
wire <em>S</em> be included in the circuit, Fig.
2, upon repeating the make and break of contact,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
the sparks will be much increased. This
arises from <em>induction</em>, each adjacent turn of
wire acting upon its neighbor. To better
understand the action of induction, we will
consider the following examples: Fig. 3. <em>A</em>
is a circuit in which is the battery cell <em>B</em>.
<em>C</em> is a second circuit lying close to but well
insulated from circuit <em>A</em>. <em>G</em> is a galvanometer
in which a magnetized needle swings
right or left each time a current is passed
through a coil of wire encircling it. Now,
although there is no battery cell in circuit <em>C</em>,
yet the needle will swing each time the circuit
<em>A</em> is closed or opened; that is, each time
the wire ends are touched together or
separated. This swing of course indicates
that a current is passing through circuit
<em>C</em>, but as there is no battery or
other source of electrical energy included
in it, it is clear that it arises from the action of
the current in circuit <em>A</em>. In point of fact,
the needle swings one way when the circuit
is closed and the reverse way when it is
opened; but the greater swing on opening
the circuit indicates the greater strength of
the <em>induced</em> current at the moment the current
ceases to flow in circuit <em>A</em>. Note that these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
current impulses are only momentary. In
the case of our single coil, Fig. 2, each turn
of wire acted upon itself in a similar manner
to the circuit <em>A</em> upon circuit <em>C</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 4., &amp; Fig. 5.</p>
</div>

<p>An iron rod or bundle of iron wires, <em>P</em>, inserted
in the coil, Fig. 4, but carefully
insulated from it, will immensely increase the
inductive effects and consequently the spark.
This arrangement constitutes the simple primary
coil used in pull-down or pendant and
automatic burners. This spark is often a
source of inconvenience; it appears wherever
a circuit including similar coils is made and
broken. In telegraph apparatus at key and
relay contacts it is noticeable; in fact, the
writer has used temporarily a pair of electro-magnets
from a telegraph sounder and obtained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
spark enough to operate a gas lighting
burner.</p>

<p>To produce a long spark which will jump
across an air gap, a more complicated form
of coil is needed, one which more closely corresponds
to the experiment noted in Fig. 3.
The simple primary coil has here another coil
of finer wire, <em>S</em>, wound on it but carefully insulated
from it (Fig. 5). This second coil, or
&ldquo;secondary,&rdquo; has a vast number of turns of
fine wire as compared with the primary, which
has only comparatively few turns of coarse
wire. A primary coil of 40 feet of No. 14
B. &amp; S. copper wire would be inserted in a
secondary coil of perhaps 16,000 feet of No.
36 B. &amp; S. This secondary coil, in fact all
the apparatus constituting the induction coil,
must be most highly insulated, as the electromotive
force of the spark is tremendous,
and it would be liable to pierce its way through
and into the internal winding and so destroy
the apparatus. The circuit in the primary is
made and broken either by a hand key or by
an automatic contact-breaker at <em>C</em>. With a
large coil, the intensity of the spark at <em>G</em> is
such that it will jump an air-gap of from one-eighth
of an inch to over three feet.<a id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>This combination of coils and contact-breaker
is generally known as a Ruhmkorff
or intensity coil, and is shown in elevation in

Multiple Gas Lighting.

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 7.</p>
</div>

<p>As we have already seen how a spark is
exhibited at an interrupted contact, the means
of its application to gas lighting will be considered.
Fig. 7 represents the most generally
used kind of electric gas burner or &ldquo;pendant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
burner.&rdquo; Its application is shown in Fig. 8.
The wire <em>W</em> from the coil <em>C</em> is attached
to the brass insulated collar carrying the contact<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<em>S</em>. The other wire from coil <em>C</em> and
battery <em>B</em> is attached to the gas pipe <em>G</em>. As
the burner is also screwed into the gas pipe
itself, the circuit would be closed were it not
for the gap at <em>A</em> on the burner, caused by the
collar carrying the contact <em>C</em> and wire <em>W</em>,
being insulated from the burner pillar <em>P</em>.
When, however, a pull is given to the burner
arm chain so as to cause the end of the spring
<em>R</em> to strike contact <em>C</em> in passing, contact is
made and broken, and a spark passes which
ignites the gas issuing from the burner tip,
the gas having previously been turned on.
A piece of chain with a metal ball is attached
to the burner arm in order to pull it down. In
this class of burner there are many different
makes differing only in minor details.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig8" src="images/fig8.jpg" width="400" height="299" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 8.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 9 shows a form of pendant burner
which has no platinum contact, but has a
broad lug on the insulated collar which is
scraped against by the spiral spring when the
arm is pulled down. It will be seen that the
lug is not held by an insulated collar on the
burner top, but is on the extension of an arm
attached to the burner pillar by a large screw
and insulating washers. The circuit wire goes
under the smaller screw seen on the lower part<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of the contact arm, this forming a strong and
neat form of attachment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig9" src="images/fig9.jpg" width="200" height="369" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 9.</p>
</div>

<p>Now it has heretofore been necessary to
turn on the gas before pulling the chain of a
pendant burner, but as this is not always desirable
the ratchet burner is made. Fig. 10
shows burner carrying a toothed wheel, which
is partly rotated when the arm is pulled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
down. This wheel is mounted on the stem
of a valve which opens or shuts according to
the point of rotation, and thus shuts off or
admits the gas to flow up to the burner. One
pull of the arm turns the gas on; at the same
time the wipe spring touches the contact on
burner collar, and the gas lights. A second
pull and the wheel, rotating, turns off the gas.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
In all burners of this class a spring is provided
to carry the arm up and back into its
original position ready for another pull. Some
burners do not make contact when the arm
flies back, thus saving battery current.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig10" src="images/fig10.jpg" width="260" height="333" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 10.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig11" src="images/fig11.jpg" width="200" height="327" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 11.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 11 is an improved form of burner
wherein the movable electrode does not pass
through the gas flame, neither do the electrodes
come in contact with each other when the gas is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
being turned off. Reference to the cut will
show a pin protruding from the base of the
coiled spring electrodes, which pin is so arranged
as to come in contact with the short
end of the pull-arm. When this pull-arm is
pulled down it pushes up this pin, elongating
the spiral spring electrode sufficiently to make
and break contact at the fixed electrode on the
burner collar. This burner can be fitted with
a porcelain candle slip if desired to match the
imitation candle burners.</p>

<h3>Stem Burners.</h3>

<p>Objection is sometimes made to the ordinary
chain pulls from the fact that they jar the
fixtures, and also are liable to bend the fixture
branches from the strain used in operating
the arm. To overcome these objections the
stem style of burner is manufactured (see
Fig. 12). This stem, it will be seen, carries
a convenient key at the end, which is turned
either right or left as in an ordinary gas-cock.
The moving contact only makes contact when
the gas is being turned on and lighted. When
turning it off, the arm is retracted so as not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
to touch the fixed electrode, thus saving battery
current.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig12" src="images/fig12.jpg" width="125" height="459" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 12.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 13 is a simple lighting attachment for
an Argand burner. The moving lever which
carries the pull has a German silver spiral<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
spring on its top end. This strikes against
the lug projecting from the circuit-wire arm
and makes a spark. The lower part of the
circuit-wire arm has a screw and washers for
ready attachment, and is strongly and substantially
made.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>A means of igniting the gas from a Welsbach
burner is shown in Fig. 14, and is so
simple as to need no further explanation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h3>Acetylene Burners.</h3>

<p>Owing to the deposits of carbon, it is
necessary to construct burners for acetylene
gas in a different and more substantial manner
than those designed for coal gas.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig14" src="images/fig14.jpg" width="130" height="304" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 14.</p>
</div>

<p>The best arrangement is depicted in Fig. 15,
which has a pilot-tube burner as well as the
two main tips. On turning the key, gas is
admitted to both main and pilot burners, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
the electrode in breaking contact only ignites
the gas at pilot burner, which, in its turn,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
acts as a lighter for the main burner. Turning
the main burner out, the pilot light can
be left burning if desired, giving a small light,
it being not feasible to turn <em>down</em> the main
burner owing to the before-mentioned carbonization.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig15" src="images/fig15.jpg" width="125" height="612" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 15.</p>
</div>

<p>The orifice of an acetylene burner is much
smaller than that of a coal gas burner, the
former burning about one-half foot per hour,
against six or seven feet of the latter.</p>

<h3>Burners for Gasolene.</h3>

<p>The flame from this gas is hotter than that
of coal gas, and deposits so much more carbon
that a slight modification is necessary in the
construction of burners for it. The details can
be readily seen on observation of a burner, being
simply in the adjustment of the contacts
and their operation. It is better, however, to use
a larger coil and a stronger battery for gasolene
gas lighting than would be needed for
coal gas&mdash;say, 6 cells of Samson, or large-size
New Standard dry battery and a 10-inch coil
having about 4 pounds or more of wire on it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<h3>Automatic Burners.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig16" src="images/fig16.jpg" width="324" height="254" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 16.</p>
</div>

<p>There are several forms of these burners,
but the principle of all is the same. A gas
burner protrudes from the top of a brass
case which encloses the actuating mechanism.
This mechanism consists generally of two
electro-magnets, the armature of one opening
the valve and allowing the gas to flow, at the
same time vibrating a platinum-tipped rod
against an electrode upon the burner collar.
This produces a series of sparks at the burner
tip which ignites the gas. A second magnet
is provided which shuts the valve and extinguishes
the gas. Some devices use one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
electro-magnet to both open and close the
valve, but the majority have double electro-magnets.
The circuit is worked from a push
button, Fig. 16, situated wherever desired;
pressure on a white button lights the gas and
on a black one shuts it off.</p>

<h3>Bartholdi Automatic Burner.</h3>

<p>Instead of a rotating stop-cock, as in other
automatics, a gravity valve is employed in
the Bartholdi, which is held to its seat by the
weight of the armature and connecting stem,
as shown in figure 17. When the gas is
turned off the valve rests upon its seat, as
indicated in the cut. By a closure of the electric
circuit at the turn-on button, two of the
helices <em>M</em> <em>P</em> are energized, causing the armature
<em>J</em> to be lifted, thus, by means of the stem
<em>H</em>, raising the valve <em>G</em> from its seat into the
dotted position, and opening the gas way so
that the gas may issue to the tip, as shown by
the arrows. At the same time, the top of the
valve strikes against the end of the lever <em>W</em>,
causing the circuit to be broken at the
spark points <em>T</em> <em>U</em>, resulting in a continuous
sparking as long as the finger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
presses the button. The magnet when
raising the armature has also twisted or
partially revolved it, so as to bring the notch
<em>d</em> in the armature over the end of the hook <em>e</em>,
as shown in the dotted lines. When the circuit
is broken by lifting the finger from the button,
the notch falls into the hook and the valve is
locked open.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig17" src="images/fig17.jpg" width="160" height="343" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 17.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>To extinguish the flame, the turn-off button
is pressed, when a second magnet (not shown
in cut) lifts the armature and twists it in the
opposite direction, so that when the circuit is
broken the armature falls free to its normal
position, closing the valve.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 18.</p>

<h3>The Advance Automatic.</h3>

<p>This automatic burner, Fig. 18, is typical of
the class having two magnets, one to open<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
valve and light gas, and another to close valve
and extinguish the light. It embodies an improvement
over the older types of burners in
that the binding posts are mounted on a rubber
strip held by two screws, thus preventing
the twisting and loosening so common heretofore.
It also allows of the valve being
opened and gas lighted by means of a match
should the battery fail.</p>

<h3>Vibrator Burner.</h3>

<p>This is an automatic burner which has no
valve mechanism, but ignites the gas only. It
is generally placed in a cluster or ring where
the burners are close enough to light by contagion.
It is much smaller in diameter than
the regular automatic burners, being but one
and three-quarter inches in diameter.</p>

<h3>Argand Automatic Burners.</h3>

<p>Automatic burners are also made for
Argand, but present no radical difference in
construction over the regular type.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Concealed Automatic Burner.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 19.</p>
</div>

<p>This automatic, Fig. 19, consists of two
iron-clad magnets, placed one above the other,
between which is located a gas valve. Through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
an extension of the latter a pin is driven, one
end acted upon by the upper armature to open
the valve and ignite the gas, the other by the
lower armature which serves to close the valve
and extinguish the flame. Around the burner
is placed a porcelain candle slip of 3/4-inch
diameter and from 4-3/4 inches in length
upwards.</p>

Connections and Wiring.
</small>
</h2>

<p>Fig. 20 shows how to connect up an automatic
burner with two pushes; thus one can
be downstairs in the hall and the other upstairs,
allowing one to either extinguish or
light the gas from either place. The value
of this arrangement is obvious; it allows one
to light up the hall before descending at night,
or to put out the gas after one is safely upstairs.
Again, an automatic burner can be
put in the cellar and lighted and extinguished
from the head of the cellar-stairs, saving
matches and danger of fire.</p>

<p>Fig. 21 shows the connections of one automatic
burner and two pendant or rachet
burners. <em>P</em> <em>P</em> are the pendent burners, <em>A</em> the
automatic burner, <em>C</em> the primary coil, <em>S</em> the
buttons which control the automatic burner,
<em>M</em> <em>M</em> <em>M</em> the cells of battery, of which there
should be at least four, if not six. A low-resistance
cell must be used here, as before<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
mentioned, one that gives not <em>less</em> than 5
amperes on short circuit. It will be seen here
that one side of the battery is connected to
ground (or gas pipe), the circuit being com<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>pleted owing to the burners being themselves
screwed into the gas pipe. Care must be
taken, however, to first see that no insulating
bushings have been used at the gas fixtures,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
as is done in wiring for electric light. In this
case a double circuit will have to be run.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 20.</p>

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 21.</p>
</div>

<p>In wiring up an automatic burner with two
electro-magnets, two wires are run, one from
the black button and one from the white
button on push-plate. Most burners have
binding posts inside the case, the wires running
through a rubber-bushed hole in the base.
One of the greatest defects in the old style
automatics arose from the two binding posts
being fixed on a hard rubber block, which was
held by one screw to the burner top. This
screw got loose at times and the block used to
twist, making it hard to tighten the wires.
But improvements have been made in this
direction, the later burners having a block
with a projection which engages in a hole in
the cover, and is held by two screws.</p>

<p>If the push has been set in place, and all
wiring done, connect up the burner, first ascertaining
to which binding post the two wires
run. This is done by having one button
pressed, the lighting (white) one, for example,
and then touching the binding post with either
wire. The lighting armature will buzz violently
when touched, whereas the extinguishing
one only strikes once when contact is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
made. When only one person is working,
a pin can be wedged in the push so as to keep
the circuit closed.</p>

<p>In setting up these burners care must be
taken not to bend contacts or alter adjustments,
and absolute precaution is necessary
that no wires touch where uninsulated. A
cause of trouble is a dirty burner which does
not allow the gas to strike the contact spark.
The collar carrying the second contact may
shift, or perhaps become short-circuited in a
pendant or ratchet burner; a strip of asbestos
will remedy this.</p>

<h3>Burner Distribution.</h3>

<p>In fitting a house with electric lighting
burners, the question of selection is best solved
as follows: For the main hall and foot of the
cellar-stairs, use the automatic burner. For
other hallways, dining-room, drawing-room,
and bathroom use ratchet burners which turn
on and light gas when chain is pulled. For
bedrooms use plain pendant burners; automatics
and ratchets add an element of danger,
in that they may not turn off gas, or may leak.
Most of this type on the market are as reliable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
as it is possible to make them, but still accidents
will happen.</p>

<p>The frontispiece shows a diagram of the
wiring in a dwelling house of medium size,
dividing it into three sections, each section being
controlled by a switch&mdash;either a hand
switch or one of the automatic cut-out switches
elsewhere described. The burners are distributed
as follows:</p>

<p>No. 1 in the front cellar, pendant or
ratchet.</p>

<p>No. 2 in the rear cellar at foot of stairway
is an automatic burner controlled from kitchen
above.</p>

<p>Nos. 3 and 4 ratchet burners on chandeliers
in drawing-room and dining-room.</p>

<p>No. 5 ratchet or pendant in kitchen.</p>

<p>No. 6 pendant in bedroom.</p>

<p>No. 7 ratchet or pendant in bathroom.</p>

<p>No. 8 pendant in bedroom.</p>

<p>No. 9 pendant in bedroom.</p>

<p>Nos. 10, 11, and 12 pendants in bedroom.</p>

<p>No. 13 automatic burner in hallway operated
from pushes in lower and in upper hallways.</p>

<p>The articles required for this job are as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Two automatic burners.</p>

<p>Three gas lighting push-buttons and bases.
Pendant and ratchet burners according to
number of lights in rooms.</p>

<p>Six cells&mdash;open circuit battery.</p>

<p>One three-lever switch.</p>

<p>One 8 or 10 inch spark coil.</p>

<p>Three pounds No. 16 patent finish office
wire.</p>

<p>Two ounces No. 24 gas-fixture wire.</p>

<p>One pound tinned 3/8" staples.</p>

<p>Few square inches tinfoil.</p>

<p>Small roll insulating tape.</p>

<p>Tools: 4-inch screwdriver, pocket knife,
4-1/2-inch side-cutting pliers, hammer, piece of
sandpaper.</p>

<p>The simple section switch is shown enlarged
in Fig. 22. The wires 1, 2, and 3 are from
their respective circuits and terminate at the
switch arms <em>A</em> <em>A</em> <em>A</em>. The wire from the
battery <em>B</em> and coil <em>C</em> runs to <em>each</em> switch-stud
<em>S</em> <em>S</em> <em>S</em>. If trouble shows on the line,
each circuit can be thrown off by moving its
switch arm until the fault is located. If it is
not found at once, and the battery is weak,
(test each cell with an ordinary electric bell),
open all the circuits until the battery is recuperated,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
and disconnect the battery wire
from the switch. Then attach the battery
wire to the bell and touch each switch lever
with a wire from the other binding post of the
bell. If there is a short circuit on any section,
the bell will ring or tremble when the arm is
touched.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig22" src="images/fig22.jpg" width="312" height="311" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 22.</p>
</div>

<p>On the contrary, if the burners fail to work
and no sign of a short circuit can be thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
obtained, it is evident that a wire is broken or
a screw is loose.</p>

<p>To locate a break, connect up the bell as just
described and attach the testing wire to the
switch with all levers closed; this is actually
putting the bell in series with the battery, coil,
and ground. Then hunt for the break. Take
a long piece of wire and fasten one end to a
ground pipe. Then touch the other end to
the circuit wire in the cellar as far as you can
go, baring the insulation in spots, but carefully
re-insulating it again. If there is no break in
the cellar, the bell will ring loudly at each
contact. Next, proceed to the next floor and
repeat the operation, gradually working <em>away</em>
from the battery. As soon as you pass the
break, the bell will fail to respond. Two persons
here are better than one, as it may be
necessary to go quite a distance from the bell
before finding the trouble.</p>

<p>Fig. 23 shows details of the wiring from
the hall light to the two push-buttons. A wire
is run right down from the top push <em>T</em>, middle
connection, past the lower push <em>L</em>, where a
similar branch joins it, until it reaches the
section switch. The lighting and extinguishing
wires from the lower push run up and are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a><br /><a id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>joined on to the similar wires from the top
push, which latter wires go directly through
the floor and ceiling to the automatic burner <em>A</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig23-24" src="images/fig23-24.jpg" width="375" height="274" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 23., &amp; Fig. 24.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 24 is the detail of the wiring for the
cellar automatic burner <em>A</em>, from the push <em>P</em>,
and is so clearly shown as not to require
further explanation.</p>

<p>The secret of success in gas-lighting work
is careful wiring. The platinum tip of the
vibrating rod is often bent, either by accidental
blow or by the continual hammering against
the tip on the collar. This often causes an
open circuit when the lighting armature refuses
to buzz. Again, soot will form, causing
weak action owing to imperfect contact.
Examine, adjust, and clean; here, as in all
electrical work, contacts must be clean.</p>

<p>In general wiring, use weatherproof office
wire, or, better still, well-made electric light
wire. For ordinary house work No. 16 B. &amp; S.
gauge is preferable; smaller wire means higher
resistance and less current at burner. For
braided office wire, No. 16 runs about 95 feet
to the pound, No. 18 about 135 feet to the
pound. The cheaper grades of wire without
the patent finish or extra insulation are not
worth using; sooner or later trouble will ensue,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and once a house is wired, it is no pleasant
job to hunt trouble, especially if the wire was
put on before the plaster. In modern buildings
in large cities, the use of conduit tubes
has become general, but the handling of these
conduits comes more under the province of
the electric-light wireman and less within the
scope of these pages.</p>

<p>In wiring new wooden buildings do not
draw wires too tight; the wood may expand
and either break wire or cause a weakening of
the insulation. In wiring before the plaster
is put on, always leave a good length free, so
it will not be covered up by the plasterers.</p>

<p>The wire used on the gas fixture is of a
special kind, being made for the purpose. It
is made in two sizes, No. 22 and No. 24
B. &amp; S. gauge, and with three windings of
cotton, three outer layers of cotton and one
of silk, or three windings of cotton which is
soaked in fireproof preparation, and then
wound with silk.</p>

<p>As the piece used is generally short, these
small sizes are sufficient in carrying capacity.
After wiring up a fixture, this fine wire can be
tied on to the pipes, etc., with thread, and a
good coating or two of shellac varnish applied.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
When this is dry, the thread can be removed
and the shellac will hold the wires on to the
fixture. On no account finally connect up the
battery to a circuit when shellacking the wire.
Wait until the shellac is thoroughly dry and
<em>hard</em>&mdash;at least half a day, if possible.</p>

<p>White lead is generally used at the joints
where the burner screws into the fixture, but
tinfoil wrapped round the joint will give good
service. It prevents leaks and ensures a good
contact.</p>

<p>The ground connection at the battery must
be first-class; do not be content with just
wrapping a few turns of wire around the pipe
in the cellar (assuming the battery is in the
cellar), but clean and scrape the pipe; clean at
least two feet of the wire, wind it tightly and
evenly on the pipe and <em>solder</em> it. There is a
pipe-clamp made which is clamped on the pipe
and the wire attached to that, but it must be
properly put on a clean surface.</p>

<h3>Wiring Finished Houses.</h3>

<p>In wiring finished houses, especially wooden
ones, the wires can be run along skirting
boards, and often pushed out of sight in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
space between the floor and the skirting. This
is quite permissible, as the wires, unlike electric-light
wires, carry no dangerous current; but
waterproof wire becomes preferable, as the
water used in washing a floor will often creep
under and rot the insulation. In going upstairs,
wires can often be run in the fluting of
a moulding along the stairway, and be quite
inconspicuous; but wherever possible, fish the
wires up inside the wall. The main thing
to be considered in wiring is that the wires are
large enough, well insulated, all joints well
made and taped and put where there is no
danger of injury. Rats have a habit of
gnawing paraffin-coated insulation, and it is
well to run such in metal tubes. In joining
or splicing wires, do it in a thorough manner,
and solder if possible. Never use the old bell-hanger
joint&mdash;the one in which the ends of
the wires are merely looped together. Strip
insulation and scrape or sand-paper bright
about three inches of each wire to be spliced.
Then, placing the bare wires across each other
about three-quarters of an inch from the insulation,
tightly wind the loose bare ends of
each around the bare inside portion of the
one it is being spliced to. A touch of solder
will prevent trouble from oxidation, after the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
adhesive tape has been wrapped on. Attention
to details like these will often ensure the
satisfactory working of the job.</p>

<p>A handy tool for gas-lighting wiring is
shown in Fig. 25. One end is bored out to
fit the small nuts on the ratchet and pendant
burners, and the other is filed flat for use as
a screw-driver.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig25" src="images/fig25.jpg" width="343" height="69" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 25.</p>
</div>

<p>A case may arise where there is electric
light on the same chandelier as the gas lights,
and that an insulating bushing has been
screwed in between the fixture and the pipe.
In this case it will be necessary to run two
wires to each burner, the pipe common return
being now unavailable. Another scheme is to
interpose an insulating bushing under each
burner; then the second or return wire need
only be run from the burner to the gas pipe
<em>outside</em> the main bushing. But the local fire-insurance
rules must first be consulted.</p>

<p>Most ceiling gas fixtures will admit of the
fixture wire being run inside the brass shell,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
which makes a neater job. But the very best
of insulation must be used, and great care be
taken that it be not abraded. It should be
shellacked or otherwise insulated before use.
The electric-light fixture wires are admirable
for use here if there is room.</p>

<p>For concealed work in a finished house,
locate the position of the fixture under the
floor of the room above by measuring
both in the room where the fixture is
and in the room above. Then cut out a piece
of the floor, drill up from underneath through
the fixture plaster-rose with a fine drill, and
push the fixture wire up. The main wire can
be laid under the carpet, or along the floor-crack
in the upstairs room.</p>

<p>In wiring up wall-fixtures, push-buttons,
etc., it is often possible to fish the wire up
from the floor by punching a hole at the fixture
and inserting a piece of chain (made for the
purpose), attached to a long and stout thread.
Then drill into the skirting near the floor
plumb underneath the first hole and fish for
the chain with a piece of wire having a hook
on the end of it. Where fixtures have brass
rosettes, these can be removed by (generally)
unscrewing the fixture, <i>but first shut off the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
gas</i> at the meter, or plug the hole; this may
seem unnecessary advice, but experience warrants
its being given. When the chain is
fished out, a piece of wire can be attached to
the thread and pulled through in turn. In
most cases its point of exit at the fixture can
be concealed by the rosette, through a hole in
which it passes. Take care that the edges of
this hole do not cut the insulation. Care must
be taken at every step in gas-lighting wiring.</p>

<p>In wiring up a push-button, screw all wires
tightly under their respective binding screws,
and then cover wherever possible with adhesive
tape. As the wires must be somewhat
loose to allow of the connections being made
at the back of the push-button at the wall, they
will have to be carefully pushed into the hole,
and if they are not tightly held by screws,
trouble will result. It is a good plan, when
using fine enough wire, to make a sort of eye
at the end of the wire and pass the screw
through this, instead of merely giving the
wire end a turn around the screw and then
driving the screw home. Of course washers
should be used wherever an ordinary screw
holds a bare wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<h3>Automatic Burner Operated by Door.</h3>

<p>One of the uses to which an automatic
burner can be put is in conjunction with an
electric door-spring, lighting when the door is
opened, but preferably extinguished by independent
push. In this case, a form of trip
spring should be used which would only make
contact during a portion of the travel of door.
Such a trip is shown in Fig. 26.</p>

<p><em>A</em> is automatic burner; <em>C</em>, the primary coil;
<em>B</em>, the battery; <em>T</em>, a swinging trip piece of
brass hinged in brass plate, <em>P</em>, which is screwed
over the door in such manner that the door
opening in direction of the arrow will cause
the trip <em>T</em> to strike against the spring <em>S</em>, and
make contact. This spring is insulated from
the plate <em>P</em> by the hard rubber block <em>R</em>.</p>

<p>On the door being opened, the trip will make
contact long enough to light the burner and
will then fall back as the door passes. On
shutting the door, the trip will be raised and
will fall as the door passes, but will not make
contact. Or, if so desired, it can be made to
operate a second contact to extinguish the
burner by fixing a second insulated spring so
it will be pressed when the top of trip makes a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a><br /><a id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>downward movement&mdash;as when the door
passes it in shutting.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig26" src="images/fig26.jpg" width="372" height="224" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 26.</p>
</div>

<p>Various applications of automatic burners
in connection with burglar alarms will suggest
themselves, but in these cases the utmost care
must be taken that the apparatus is in good
working order; failure to light might cause the
room to be filled with gas, and serious results
ensue.</p>

<p>For those persons who use gas stoves and
are mechanically inclined, an arrangement of
an alarm clock with an automatic burner will
enable them to light up without getting out
of bed, or perhaps even waking up.</p>

Primary Coils and Safety Devices.
</small>
</h2>

<p>To construct a primary coil such as used
with pendant or automatic burners presents no
difficulty. The most convenient sizes are those
8 to 10 inches in length and about 3 inches in
diameter. It is quite common to speak of these
coils as <em>8 or 10 inch coils</em>; to the writer&rsquo;s
knowledge this has been taken to mean a
Ruhmkorff or double-wound induction coil,
giving a free 8 or 10 inch spark.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig27" src="images/fig27.jpg" width="175" height="86" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 27.</p>
</div>

<p>To make such a coil (Fig. 27), proceed as
follows: Prepare a spool by gluing a paper
or fibre tube 3/4 inch in outside diameter by
about 1-16 inch thick into square or round<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
spool ends three inches square, one-half inch
thick, and having each a centre hole just large
enough to admit of the tube being held tightly.
These ends should be firmly fixed on the tube;
a pin or two driven through tube into end
will assist in strengthening the joint. Now
wind on the tube about 3 pounds No. 12
B. &amp; S. cotton-covered magnet wire. This
will give about six layers of 80 turns each,
nearly 500 turns in all, a total length of, say,
150 feet, measuring .25 ohm. The ends of the
wire are to be brought out through holes
drilled in the spool ends, and can be fixed to
brass binding posts on those ends.</p>

<p>Into the paper tube push as many iron wires
8 inches long by No. 22 B. W. gauge as will
fill it. These iron wires can be tightened
finally by driving in at each end, a stout wire
nail.</p>

<p>Although not absolutely necessary, a coat
or two of shellac varnish applied to the windings
will make a better insulation. Shellac
varnish is readily made by dissolving one part
gum shellac in four parts of alcohol. For
coils which are likely to be in damp places,
a good saturation with insulating compound,
such as P. &amp; B. paint, will render them waterproof.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
The need for good insulation in these
primary coils is not so urgent as in Ruhmkorff
coils, owing to the lower potential of the current.</p>

<p>A smaller coil can be made with No. 14
B. &amp; S. wire where the battery is of higher
resistance (or gives less than ten amperes on
short circuit). The remarks on battery selection
on another page will be found to meet
application here.</p>

<h3>Automatic Cut-outs.</h3>

<p>Where there are a number of burners to be
installed in different parts of a house, it becomes
desirable to wire in a number of circuits.
As one end of the circuit is already
grounded, a second ground will cause material
injury to the battery if not detected in time.
It becomes, therefore, necessary to be able to
open a grounded circuit without affecting all
the lights in a house. This is possible with
the multiple circuit arrangement by using a
switch, either automatic or operated by hand.</p>

<p>The simplest form of danger signal is the
relay electric bell attachment, which device is
mounted on the end of the gas-lighting coil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
It consists of an armature which closes a circuit
when attracted by the coil core, in which
circuit are included a battery and electric bell.</p>

<p>Now when an ordinary pendant or ratchet
burner is pulled, it only sends a momentary
current through the coil, enough to magnetize
the core, but not enough to attract the armature
sufficiently long for the bell to ring. But if
a short circuit or ground should occur, the
armature is held against the contact long
enough to cause the bell to ring and give
warning. In some cases a constant ringing
attachment is added, in which case the bell
rings until some one stops it.</p>

<h3>The Syracuse Cut-out.</h3>

<p>This is a most ingenious device for opening
a short circuit, depending on its action upon
the sluggish movement of glycerine (Fig. 28).</p>

<p>A sealed glass tube pivoted near its centre
contains a portion of glycerine sufficient to
considerably overbalance it and keep one end
down. A soft iron armature is attached to
this tube in such manner that each time a
current flows through a pair of electro-magnets,
the attraction of the armature causes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
the tube to tilt and the glycerine flows along
to the other end. Now it will be readily seen
that if the tube is only tilted for a second or
so, the slow-moving glycerine will not have
flowed sufficiently to the end to overbalance it,
but it requires an attraction of the armature
for a considerable period. This electro-magnet
is in circuit with the gas-lighting
wires, the tube being provided with contacts
in such manner that, when fully tilted, the
circuit is broken. The momentary jerks imparted
to the armature by the operation of a
pendant or automatic burner will not be
enough to permanently tilt the tube and break<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
contact, but a short circuit will hold the armature
tight down, until the increasing weight
of glycerine causes the tube to open the circuit.</p>

<h3>Automatic Sectional Cut-out.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 30.</p>
</div>

<p>This cut-out, Fig. 29, is representative of
the class which use clockwork, and is both
simple and reliable. The house circuit is in
series with an electro-magnet which controls
a clockwork having a long pinion shaft. This
clockwork starts and runs while the house
circuit is closed, as on operating a burner,
but stops when the circuit is opened and flow
of current ceases. The wires leading to different
circuits in the building run through a
number of contact springs mounted on sliding
rods, which have teeth cut on the under side
(Fig. 30). These rods have soft iron armatures
on the opposite ends from the contact
springs, which rest over electro-magnets, also
connected to the house circuits. When the
clockwork starts, the pinion shaft revolves, but
does not engage in any of the sliding rods, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
they just clear it. Should a heavy or continuous
current pass through one of the
electro-magnets, it attracts the armature on
the corresponding rod (Fig. 31), and the
turning pinion engages in the teeth, drawing
up the rod and breaking contact.</p>

<p>Fig. 32 is a form of battery protector
which works on the gravity principle. Here
each section is governed by a rocking contact,
operated by two glass bulbs partially filled
with a volatile fluid (such as ether), and
joined by a glass tube. In one of these bulbs
is a platinum wire which is included in the
circuit and heats upon the passage of a strong
or continuous current. If the circuit is closed
too long, the heating of the platinum wire
causes the fluid to flow into the upper bulb,
and, as the bulbs are pivoted, the increased
weight of the upper bulb now overbalances the
rocker and breaks the circuit on that section.</p>

Lighting of Large Buildings.

</h2>

<p>The jump spark system is used where it is
desired to light clusters of gas jets situated
in inaccessible places, or a number of them
simultaneously. The spark from a Ruhmkorff
coil, being made by a contact broken at
the coil and not at the burner, can be divided
up among a number of simple burners placed
in series. One of the burners used and known
as the Smith jump spark burner is shown in
Fig. 33. The wires from the coil are attached
to the electrodes shown on each side of the
burner, and the spark jumps across the gap,
situated nearly over the burner orifice. There
is a guard-flange of mica round the lower
part.</p>

<p>Fig. 34 shows the manner in which the
jump spark is applied to a Welsbach burner.
A small porcelain clip carrying the spark-gap
wires is held on the top of the burner chimney.
The electrodes project down into the chimney<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
so that a draught of air cannot carry the
stream of gas away from the spark-gap.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig33-34-35" src="images/fig33-34-35.jpg" width="309" height="410" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 33., Fig. 34. &amp; Fig. 35</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 35 shows a burner intended for the
stage of a theatre, or where the lights are
located in dangerous and inaccessible places.
The burner is made of porcelain upon which
are spun the metal top and bottom. One<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
electrode is also clamped around it, allowing
of adjustment and better insulation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig36" src="images/fig36.jpg" width="349" height="286" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 36.</p>
</div>

<p>These burners are used in series, as shown
in Fig. 36. <em>B B B</em> are the burners; <em>S S</em>, the
secondary wires from the Ruhmkorff coil, <em>I</em>;
<em>P P</em>, the primary coil wires from battery,
opened and closed by means of the key, <em>K</em>.</p>

<p>It is often possible to place plain burners
close enough so that they can ignite by contagion.
In this case one of the plain burners<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
is removed and replaced by a multiple burner,
as above.</p>

<p>It is customary to allow sixteen burners
to one inch of spark, in which case the spark
gaps are adjusted about one-sixteenth of an
inch apart. A coil giving a 2-inch spark
would operate 32 burners, but actually it
would be found preferable to omit a few, so as
to make allowance for any slight leak. A
spark of over 2 inches is hard to handle, although
often used; it is better to make up a
number of circuits of, say, 30 burners each,
and operate them alternately by a suitable
switch.</p>

<p>The wire used to connect the burners is
generally bare, although an insulated wire is
sometimes used. But the electromotive force
of a 2-inch spark is so high that it is better
to run the wires so they do not come near
anything liable to cause a leak. The remarkable
tendency of these high-tension currents
must be most carefully guarded against;
indeed, it is what makes this style of gas
lighting so often unsuccessful. A damp wall,
gilt wall-paper, a gas pipe hidden in the plaster,
will often lead off the current. The wires
should be at least 50 per cent. further off<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
from any object than the spark length; that is,
a 2-inch spark circuit should be at least 3
inches away from a wall, and the further the
better. It cannot be too strongly urged that
every precaution be taken to keep the wires
away from objects other than their insulators.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig37" src="images/fig37.jpg" width="260" height="279" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 37.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 37 shows the special form of insulator
used. It is made of the highest grade glaze
filled porcelain, and the screw is passed into
it and holds against the lower end as far away
from the wire as possible.</p>

<p>Glass tubes should be passed over the wires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
wherever they come near any metallic object,
that is, within sparking distance.</p>

<h3>Edwards&rsquo; Condenser System.</h3>

<p>This system differs from the foregoing in
that the spark-gaps are connected in multiple,
instead of series, and each burner is provided
with a small but efficient condenser.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig38" src="images/fig38.jpg" width="250" height="143" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 38.</p>
</div>

<p>It prevents trouble should a wire break
between burners, in which event only one
burner would be out of commission, whereas
in the first method, the whole number in that
series would suffer. It is also more sure in
action and presents less liability of the spark
jumping to the ground. The burner pillars
need not be made of porcelain or lava; in fact,
the electrodes can be readily attached to the
existing burner. Fig. 38 is a condenser consisting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of a small oval piece of mica, on each
side of which is fastened, with insulating
varnish, a spatula-shaped piece of tinfoil.
One foil sheet is attached to the line, the other
to the burner electrode. These condensers
must not be allowed to get wet or their efficiency
will be impaired.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig39-40" src="images/fig39-40.jpg" width="290" height="291" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 39. &amp; Fig. 40</p>
</div>

<p>Figs. 39 and 40 are the most generally used
burners, the wire from the condenser being
attached to the lug or top electrode, which is
insulated from the burner by means of the
mica plate to which it is riveted. The burner
pillars are of course grounded through their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
being screwed into the gas pipe. The circuit
is shown in Fig. 41. <em>I</em> is the induction or
Ruhmkorff coil, in the primary circuit of which
is the key, <em>K</em>, controlling the current from the
battery, <em>B</em>, and across which is bridged the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
condenser, <em>C C</em>. When the coil vibrator is
used, the condenser <em>C C</em> can be omitted, that
of the coil itself serving instead. <em>S</em> is the wire
leading from the secondary terminal of the
coil to the burner condenser, <em>C</em>, which, in turn,
are connected to the electrodes on the burners,
<em>P P</em>, as before noted. The other secondary
wire is grounded preferably to the gas pipe
itself.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig41" src="images/fig41.jpg" width="350" height="312" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 41.</p>
</div>

<p>Where a lot of burners are placed together,
as in a ring, it is often feasible to light them
by contagion, one tip only being connected to
the coil circuit, the others lighting from it and
conveying the flame around to the rest. This
avoids multiplicity of circuits, or, perhaps, too
many burner gaps on one circuit; but the
one burner may fail to light, whereas, where
all are fitted, the chances of failure are less,
especially in the Edwards condenser system.</p>

<h3>Switch for Jump Spark-lighting.</h3>

<p>In a switch for controlling the current of
the secondary coil it will be evident that the
utmost attention must be paid to matters of
insulation. The object of such a switch is to
control a number of circuits; for example,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a><br /><a id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>as it is not advisable to put more than 20 to 25
burners on one circuit, a case requiring the
lighting of 100 burners would necessitate some
means of passing the current to each circuit in
turn. This is shown in Fig. 42, in which <em>S</em>
is a hard rubber plate, provided with a revolving
metal arm and handle, <em>H</em>, and four
contact points, <em>P</em>, which latter receive the ends
of the wires from the groups of burner condensers
<em>B</em> by means of nuts or binding posts.
The wire from the secondary of the coil is
run to the switch-handle, <em>H</em>, great care being
taken that it does not pass near to the circuit
wires, or contact points. Revolving the
switch-handle connects the secondary wire to
each circuit in turn. It will be noticed that,
unlike a battery switch, this one has a large
base, long switch-arm, contact points situated
far apart, and every precaution taken to control
the passage of the high-tension current.
The base should always be of rubber or
glass. Shellacked-wood, or such substitutes,
are productive of trouble.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig42" src="images/fig42.jpg" width="332" height="262" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 42.</p>
</div>

<p>When it is desired to light automatically
a number of burners from a distance, the
Trailer (Fig. 43), is used. This is a switch
similar to above, but the arm is revolved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
by means of toothed wheels by the electro-magnet
shown on the back. As it is
never desirable to unnecessarily prolong the
secondary wires, this device admits of the
switch being put near the circuits, and yet
being operated from afar.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<h3>Ruhmkorff Coil.</h3>

<p>Fig. 44 shows a diagram of a Ruhmkorff
coil, the letters referring as follows:</p>

<p><em>C</em> the iron core, <em>P</em> the primary coil wires,
<em>I</em> the insulating tube between primary <em>P</em> and
the secondary coil <em>S</em>. In small coils this may
be dispensed with, and a heavy layer of paraffin
wax laid over the primary coil. <em>D D</em> are
the ends of the secondary, showing sparking
taking place between a pair of balls (or between
the electrodes of a gas burner); <em>R</em> is
a stiff spring fastened to the coil base and
carrying a soft iron hammer, which is attracted
toward the iron core, <em>C</em>, when current
passes through the primary coil and magnetizes
it. <em>L</em> is a battery, <em>J</em>, a condenser, to be
more fully described later on. When the
spring <em>R</em> touches the adjustment screw <em>A</em> at <em>B</em>,
as they are insulated from each other, contact
is made and reference to circuit will show that
the current from battery <em>L</em> flows through
primary coil, magnetizing the core and attracting
soft iron hammer on <em>R</em>. As this
bends forward, it breaks contact at <em>B</em>, the
core loses its magnetism and the spring flies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
back, to again make contact. This is repeated
many times per second.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig44" src="images/fig44.jpg" width="350" height="290" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 44.</p>
</div>

<p>As a heavy spark occurs at <em>B</em> on the break
of contact, the condenser, <em>J</em>, is attached at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
<em>M K</em>. This is a series of insulated tinfoil
sheets, which has the property of nullifying
the spark at <em>B</em>, and so preventing the waste
of platinum with which both adjustment
screw <em>A</em> and spring <em>R</em> are equipped.</p>

<p>A Ruhmkorff coil differs from a simple
primary coil in three main points. Two separate
coils instead of one; high insulation, and
a primary coil of few turns. In the simple
coil we desired self-induction; here, we desire
to avoid it as much as possible.</p>

<p>The average size Ruhmkorff coil, for jump
spark work, would be one giving a 2-inch
spark, specifications for which are as follows:</p>

<p><em>Spool</em>&mdash;Nine inches long by one inch in
diameter. End cheeks 4 inches high by 3
inches wide.</p>

<p><em>Core</em>&mdash;Sufficient soft iron wires, 9 inches
long by No. 22 B. W. gauge as will fill the
spool tube.</p>

<p><em>Primary</em>&mdash;Two layers No. 14 B. &amp; S.
gauge cotton-covered copper wire.</p>

<p><em>Secondary</em>&mdash;Two and one-half pounds No.
36 B. &amp; S. gauge double cotton or silk-covered
magnet wire wound in four sections (or more
than four sections, if feasible).</p>

<p><em>Condenser</em>&mdash;Seventy sheets tinfoil 4 by 7-1/2<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
inches; 80 sheets condenser paper 5 by 8
inches.</p>

<h3>Spool.</h3>

<p>This should be made up of a fibre tube 9
inches in length by about 1/16 inch thick, and
should be firmly fixed into the spool ends.
If it be glued in it should also be pinned as
well; it is easily possible to drive in a few
screws passing through the tube into the spool
ends, particularly as the soft iron core, being
of loose wires, will adapt itself to the slightly
projecting screw-heads. Remember that this
spool must be made strong; if it comes apart
during the winding process, much trouble will
ensue, and perhaps all the wires lost or ruined.
For reasons to be seen later, do not affix the
right-hand spool end yet, but have it ready.
The core consists of as many fine iron wires,
say of No. 22 B. W. gauge, as can be forced
into the tube, but the core can better be added
after the windings are all in; that is, in such
cases where a rigid spool tube is used.</p>

<h3>Primary Winding.</h3>

<p>This consists of two layers of No. 14 B. &amp; S.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
gauge cotton (or silk) covered copper magnet
wire, and should be evenly and tightly laid
on. For winding coils, a lathe is a most
handy machine, or the spool can be mounted
on a spindle and rotated by hand. It is not
feasible here to give all details of coil-construction;
reference should be made to the
many excellent works on the subject. The
two ends are brought out through holes in the
spool ends, as indicated for the simple primary
coil before described. After winding, the
wire is to be well basted with melted paraffin
wax until it is saturated, any excess being
scraped off so as to leave a smooth cylindrical
surface for the secondary coil. Half a dozen
turns of stout paper or oiled silk is now to be
wound on, and enough paraffin wax added to
leave an insulation at least one-quarter of an
inch around the outside of the winding.
The right-hand end of spool, where the end
was not attached, will require a little care
that the wire does not run off; but, as only
two layers are to be wound, it is an easy thing
to do.</p>

<p>When the primary coil is finished off, cut
three pieces of hard rubber four inches square,
with a central hole just big enough that they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
may be slipped on over the primary coil to
form divisions into which the secondary wire
goes. These can be fixed equal distances
apart by means of removable wooden blocks,
which are taken off as each section is wound.</p>

<h3>Secondary Coil.</h3>

<p>The secondary coil consists of about 2-1/2
pounds No. 36 B. &amp; S. gauge silk or cotton-covered
magnet wire, wound evenly in layers
in the sections on the primary coil. Before
any wire goes into a section, it must be seen
that the division fits tight to the primary coil.
It will be best to pour around the coil some
melted paraffin wax so as to form an insulating
ring, and prevent any possibility of the
spark creeping under the section division into
the next. The actual operation of winding
presents no difficulty other than those of
keeping the wire from damage and getting as
even layers as possible. If each layer is separated
from its neighbor by a strip of paraffined
paper, it makes even winding easier, and better
insulation. As to the insulating of the
secondary coil, it can be done in a variety of
ways. The coil can be soaked in molten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
paraffin until saturated, or the wire can be
made to pass through a dish of molten
paraffin while on its way from the wire reel to
the coil. In the latter case the wire must be
guided by means of glass rollers, as the wax
would harden rapidly if touched by the fingers.
In connecting up the sections, the similar ends
are to be joined; that is, the inside ends to
inside ends, and outside ends to outside
ends, as per diagram (Fig. 45). This will
bring two outside ends free for attachment
to binding posts. Fig. 46 shows direction of
winding and connecting the two middle coils,
<em>A C</em> being the inside layers next to primary
and <em>B D</em> the outside layers.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig45" src="images/fig45.jpg" width="350" height="177" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 45.</p>
</div>

<p>An outside coat of paraffin wax is now
given to the coil and a wrapping of waxed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
paper laid on. Then, if desired, a cover of
sheet-rubber or a layer of cloth can be put on
over all, to finish the job.</p>

<h3>Base, Key, and Condenser.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig46" src="images/fig46.jpg" width="334" height="295" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 46.</p>
</div>

<p>The base for a Ruhmkorff coil generally resembles
an oblong shallow box. The coil is
mounted on the lid, and the condenser inside
the box, the connections being made on the
lower side of the lid. It is preferable, except
for appearance&rsquo; sake, to make all connections<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
outside the box, but this is left to the worker&rsquo;s
choice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig47" src="images/fig47.jpg" width="200" height="287" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 47.</p>
</div>

<p><em>The Condenser</em> is made up of 70 sheets of
tinfoil each about 4 inches by 7-1/2, and 80 sheets
of clean white paper 5 by 8 inches placed alternately,
and saturated with paraffin wax.
The tinfoil sheets are laid so that about 1/2 inch
projects out of the paper sheets at each end,
the alternate sheets coming out at the same
end, and the projecting pieces being bent
together gives the effect of a pair of tinfoil
sheets insulated from each other, aggregating
the sum of all the small ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig48" src="images/fig48.jpg" width="180" height="287" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 48.</p>
</div>

<p>The coil can now be attached to the base by
means of screws passing through the lid into
the coil ends. If a vibrating contact breaker
be desired, reference to Fig. 44 will show
method of connection. Fig. 47 shows details
of a contact breaker of similar design. <em>R</em> is
hammer head of soft iron, <em>S</em> a spring about
thickness of clock spring and 3/8 inch wide
or more. <em>B</em> is contact point, both spring and
adjustment screw <em>A</em> being fitted with platinum
contacts. <em>C</em> is a check nut, to hold <em>A</em> from
turning. <em>I</em> is an adjustment to tighten or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
loosen spring <em>S</em>, by means of a lug which it
carries on its shaft. It is well insulated from
pillar carrying <em>A</em>, by the hard rubber bushing,
<em>I</em>.</p>

<p>The condenser is laid in the box under the
coil and attached as in Fig. 44; that is, one
set of sheets to the contact pillar, and the
other set to the adjustment screw.</p>

<p>For gas-lighting work, it is generally
preferable to use a contact or strap key
(Fig. 48), instead of a vibrator. The key
can be mounted on coil base, in which case
the condenser will be attached in same manner
as for the vibrator.</p>

<small>
How to Select Batteries for Gas Lighting.
</small>
</h2>

<p>Before entering into a description of the
various batteries used in electric gas lighting,
it will be well to briefly consider a few simple
electrical rules bearing upon the subject.</p>

<p>A current of electricity has <em>electromotive
force</em>, or <em>difference of potential</em> figured in
<em>volts</em>, and <em>current</em> figured in <em>amperes</em>.</p>

<p>For example we will use the <em>water</em> analogy
(Fig. 49). Two tanks, <em>A</em> <em>B</em>, on the same
level, are connected by a pipe <em>C</em>.</p>

<p>Supposing tank <em>A</em> be filled with water and
the pipe, <em>C</em>, to be opened; the water will flow
along <em>C</em> into <em>B</em> until the level in each tank is
equal. So long as there is a difference of
level, there will be a pressure in <em>C</em>, owing to
the water behind it.</p>

<p>Replacing the tanks <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> by unequally
electrified bodies, and the pipe <em>C</em> by a conductor
of electricity, the flow of water is represented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
by the tendency of the electrified
bodies to equalize themselves by a flow of
current along the conductor, <em>C</em>.</p>

<p>To sum up: The difference of level is now
difference of potential, the pounds pressure
along the pipe being expressed as electromotive
force in <em>volts</em>.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig49" src="images/fig49.jpg" width="338" height="144" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 49.</p>
</div>

<p>The quantity of water flowing along the
pipe is measured, as electricity, in amperes.
As the quantity of water passing in a given
time is regulated by the size of the pipe and
its own pressure, so the quantity of electricity
is also regulated. A conductor of electricity
offers resistance to the flow of current according
to its sectional area and the material of
which it is composed, this resistance being expressed
in <em>ohms</em>. The greater the voltage and
lower the resistance, the more current. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
law, and its kindred applications, are expressed
as follows:</p>

<p class="centered-block">
<em>C = E/R.</em><br />
</p>

<p><em>C</em> is current in amperes, <em>E</em> electromotive force
in volts, and <em>R</em> resistance in ohms.</p>

<p>Thus a wire with a resistance of 50 ohms
would pass 2 amperes with an electromotive
force of 100 volts. To find resistance when
other two factors are known, the formula is</p>

<p class="centered-block">
<em>R = E/C.</em><br />
</p>

<p>In selecting a battery for work, regard
must be made to the current required, and its
period of flow. For energizing a gas lighting
primary coil, the current must be large, but is
only required occasionally, the battery standing
idle for long periods. In this case the
class called open circuit cells are preferable,
as they contain no strong acids and do not
deteriorate to any extent when not in use.
Of such class is the Leclanche-Samson,
Monarch, carbon cylinder, and most so-called
dry cells. As the resistance in a conductor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
affects the current flow, so it does in a
battery cell; the internal resistance of a battery
is determined by its size, proximity of the
elements, etc. Cells with small zincs and
porous cups are of high internal resistance,
those with large sheet zincs and big carbon
surfaces, of low internal resistance. As the
primary coil used in gas lighting is never
much over one ohm, a cell of low internal resistance
should be selected. But as the wires
leading to the burners must be taken into
account, a number of cells should be used to
produce enough electromotive force to overcome
the added resistance. Now battery cells
can be arranged in a variety of ways&mdash;in series
for higher electromotive force, and in multiple&mdash;for
greater current.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig50" src="images/fig50.jpg" width="318" height="111" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 50.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 50 represents the series arrangement;
here the zinc of one cell is connected to the
carbon of the next; this adds the electromotive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
forces together and thus gives greater
ability to overcome resistance, but it also
adds together the resistance of each cell. Thus
4 cells, each 2 volts and of one-half ohm internal
resistance, would, in series, have an
E. M. F. of 8 volts and an internal resistance
of 2 ohms, current 4 amperes. Fig. 51 shows
four cells in multiple, the zinc of each cell and
the carbons of each cell are connected. Here
the result would be but 2 volts, but the internal
resistance would be only one-quarter,
viz: one-eighth of an ohm, current 16
amperes.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig51" src="images/fig51.jpg" width="343" height="100" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 51.</p>
</div>

<p>The readiest rule for connecting a battery
is to arrange it according to the resistance of
the line or outside wiring. So as we will
have to use house-wiring far exceeding in
length that on the coil, and probably of less
diameter. Therefore the series arrangement
will be the one to use, and not less than four
cells of a low-resistance battery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<h3>The Leclanche.</h3>

<p>This battery consists of a carbon rod surrounded
by granular peroxide of manganese
forming the positive pole and a piece of zinc
for the negative pole, both elements being immersed
in a solution of sal ammoniac (chloride
of ammonia). If a wire be run <em>outside</em> the
solution and connecting the carbon and zinc,
a current of electricity flows along it. The
chemical action taking place is as follows:
The zinc combines with the chlorine of the
solution, liberating free hydrogen and ammonia.
The hydrogen appears at the carbon,
where it is acted upon by the oxygen of the
peroxide of manganese. If too much current
is taken from the cell, that is, if the wire or
circuit be of too low resistance, the oxidizing
action of the peroxide is not rapid enough,
and a film of hydrogen, which is a poor conductor,
forms over the carbon and increases
the resistance of the battery&mdash;also setting up
what is termed &ldquo;local action&rdquo; (actually, a
battery opposing a battery).</p>

<p>After a rest, the hydrogen is absorbed,
but a cell rarely regains its pristine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
activity after too severe demands upon
it. The original Leclanche batteries were
imported from France, the home of the
inventor, but of recent years they are
made in the United States, England and
Germany. The most important point to be
considered in a galvanic cell is the purity of
its active parts. The zincs should be as near<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
chemically pure as can be obtained; the peroxide
of manganese of the best quality and perfectly
free from foreign substances, and the
sal ammoniac the purest that can be manufactured.
The actual difference in work between
a battery so constructed, and the
average cheap cell sold at a price to catch the
unwise, is tremendous. And this difference is
indicated, not only in work, but when the battery
is at rest. Local action in a cheap
battery will exhaust it even when it is not in
circuit, whereas a battery cell of good material
will remain in good order for months
without more attention than the addition of
water or sal ammoniac. It has been often
remarked that the batteries made to-day are
inferior to those made years ago, but it is
only true of the cheap-priced cells; if a good
price is paid and attention given to securing
a well made cell, the output will be as satisfactory.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig52" src="images/fig52.jpg" width="250" height="374" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 52.</p>
</div>

<p>To set up a Leclanche cell, proceed as
follows: Put six ounces of sal ammoniac into
the glass jar; fill the jar one-third full of <em>clear</em>
water and stir. Put in the porous cup and fill
the jar with water up to its neck, pouring a
few teaspoonfuls of water into the hole in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
porous cup. When the cell is in working
condition, the level of the solution will be
found to have receded, owing to absorption
by the porous cup. To prevent the creeping
of sal ammoniac up the neck of jar and on to
the terminals of the cell, a layer of paraffin is
applied to neck of jar and porous cup.
Should this need renewing, vaseline can be
used, or any heavy grease, care being taken
that it does not get on electrodes or where
the wires are to be fastened. When the cell
refuses to work, throw out old solution, wash
porous cup, jar and zinc in warm water, and
replace with new solution. There is a limit,
when a new porous cup must be used, but this
can be done when cell does not work after
being treated as above. The electromotive
force of the Leclanche cell is about 1.45, and
current on short circuit of nearly one ampere,
depending of course on thickness and porosity
of porous cup, size of zinc, and a few other
points.</p>

<h3>The Samson Cell.</h3>

<p>Fig. 53 is one of the Leclanche group, in
which a compound carbon element displaces
the earthenware porous cup. This<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
carbon is composed of two parts, a hollow-fluted
lower piece and a threaded top, which
carries the binding post. In the process of
manufacture, the top piece is heated red-hot
and plunged into hot paraffin wax, thus ensuring
a complete diffusion of the paraffin throughout
the carbon. In this way the creeping of salt
or solution, and consequent corrosion of electrodes
and failure of cell, are avoided. The
lower portion is much more porous than the
upper and is filled with a combination of pea-carbon
and peroxide of manganese held in by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
plug at the bottom. This plug can be removed
and new depolarizer added. Directions
given by the manufacturers for renewing this
element are to hold the lower end of the carbon
over a burner flame until the plug is softened
and can be removed, or to immerse the
extreme lower end of the carbon in boiling
water. After refilling, a cork plug can be
used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig53" src="images/fig53.jpg" width="250" height="341" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 53.</p>
</div>

<p>The E. M. F. of the No. 2 size is from 1.40
to 1.47 volts, and current, on short circuit, of
12 to 16 amperes. The No. 2 Special has
same E. M. F., but current of only 5 amperes,
being intended where strong current is not
required but quick recuperation. It will be
seen that this cell is far more suited to
electric gas-lighting work than the simple
Leclanche, owing to its great current delivery.</p>

<h3>The Dry Cell.</h3>

<p>Of so-called dry cells there are numbers
on the market at so low a price that it does
not pay to make one&rsquo;s own. But for those
who wish to do so, the following formula,
furnished by Mr. Wm. Roche, of New Standard
battery fame, will be found excellent:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>One pint CLEAR WATER.</p>

<p>Five ounces sal ammoniac.</p>

<p>Six ounces zinc chloride.</p>

<p>Dissolve the sal ammoniac in the water
thoroughly. Let stand twenty-four hours.
Then add the zinc chloride, and when cool,
will be ready for use.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When you have your zinc cup ready, pour
a little wax in the bottom, to insulate; place a
piece of blotting-paper inside cup and laying
tight against the zinc, about three turns. The
negative element is prepared as follows: One
pound pure carbon, powdered; one pound
black oxide manganese; mix thoroughly.
Then add sufficient of above solution to
hold it together without being plastic, as that
would be too wet to tamp.</p>

<p>Moisten your paper in the zinc cup
thoroughly. Place your stick or plate of
carbon in centre of zinc cup, hold it there
central while you pack in the carbon manganese
element all around it; be sure that carbon
manganese, or negative element, does not
touch zinc cup. If it does, your cell will run
down quickly. It is a good precaution to
have your paper half an inch higher than cup<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
when in the cup, and soaked with the solution.
Give it a couple of quick taps on the bench;
that will curl the paper in at the bottom and
insure against any internal short circuit.
When your cell is filled up, clean all the carbon
element away from the zinc. Seal, and
your battery is ready when you&rsquo;ve got the
connections on.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig54" src="images/fig54.jpg" width="200" height="498" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 54.</p>
</div>

<h3>The New Standard Dry Cell.</h3>

<p>The principal sizes of this cell (Fig. 54)
are as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p><b>
No. 2&mdash;5-7/8 &times; 2-7/16.<br />
No. 3&mdash;3-3/4 &times; 1-7/8.<br />
No. 5&mdash;6 &times; 2-9/16.<br />
No. 6&mdash;6 &times; 3.<br />
No. 7&mdash;7 &times; 3.<br />
</b></p>

<p>The electromotive force is 1.5 volts, current
of the No. 7 size on short circuit, 24 amperes.
Nos. 2, 5, 6, or 7 are most suitable for electric
gas lighting, either by simple primary coil or
jump spark coil.</p>

<h3>The Edison Lalande Cell.</h3>

<p>This cell (Fig. 55), gives a large, steady
current and is of low internal resistance, but
its electromotive force is not high, being less
than .7 volt on closed circuit. Its output of
current varies with the size, type <em>S</em> being
.025 ohm internal resistance and capacity of
300 ampere-hours. The Edison Lalande cell
can be applied to electric gas lighting in cases
where a large demand is made upon the battery,
for example in church or theatre lighting.</p>

<p>Its elements consist of positive plates of
amalgamated zinc suspended on each side of
negative plates of black oxide of copper. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
electrolyte is an aqueous solution of caustic
soda. A layer of heavy paraffin oil is poured
on top of the solution to prevent the solution
from evaporating and also to keep the soda
crystals from creeping up and over the rim
of the jar.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig55" src="images/fig55.jpg" width="250" height="392" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 55.</p>
</div>

<p>To set up an Edison Lalande cell, fill the
jar up to the brown mark with clear water;
pour in the soda from the tin box, <em>and stir</em>.
When thoroughly dissolved, pour on top of
the solution one half-inch layer of <em>the oil
which is sent with the battery</em>. Then the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
elements attached to the cover can be inserted,
and the cell is ready for use.</p>

<p>Use care not to splash the solution, as it
will burn the clothing and skin. If any
does get on, a little animal grease or vegetable
oil will quickly saponify it.</p>

<p>In the action of this cell the oxide of copper
is reduced to metallic copper and the zincs
consumed, it being intended that each element
will require renewal at the same time. Upon
picking into the oxide plate with a sharp-pointed
instrument, if the plate is red throughout,
it is exhausted; but, should it show black
in its interior, it is still capable of a little more
use, but is preferable to use a new plate whenever
there is but little oxide left.</p>

<p>Never remove the oxide plates from the
battery, and do not allow the solution to be
less than one inch above oxide plates.</p>

<h3>The Fuller, or Bichromate Cell.</h3>

<p>Although not often necessary in gas-lighting
work, there is at times a demand for a heavy
current, such as in lighting a big building,
where a large coil must be operated. At such
times a bichromate of potash cell becomes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
service. One of the types is shown in Fig. 56.
<em>J</em> is a jar containing electropoion fluid described
below. <em>C</em> is a carbon plate immersed
in this fluid. <em>P</em> is a porous cup holding the
zinc, <em>Z</em>, and being filled with a solution of 18
parts common salt, 72 parts water, and one
ounce mercury.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig56" src="images/fig56.jpg" width="200" height="230" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 56.</p>
</div>

<p>The electropoion fluid for the outer jar is
made by one pound bichromate of potash or
soda to one gallon of water, mixing in a stone
vessel. When dissolved, add three pounds
commercial sulphuric acid carefully, a little
at a time, and stir the mixture constantly as it
gets hot. Always add the acid to the mixture;
never attempt to pour the mixture into the
acid, or trouble will result. The sodium salt
is preferable to the potassium, owing to its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
greater solubility and its not forming <em>chrome
alum</em>&mdash;a hard precipitate which sticks to jars,
elements, etc., to their detriment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig57" src="images/fig57.jpg" width="140" height="342" alt="" />
<p class="caption smcap">Fig. 57.</p>
</div>

<p>Fig. 57, a form of battery known as the
Grenet battery, is used where there is no
porous cup. The zinc element, <em>Z</em>, is mounted
on a rod <em>R</em> passing through the cap <em>G</em> of a
glass jar, <em>J</em>, and can be raised or lowered into
the electropoion fluid which the jar contains.
This is a good scheme where the battery is
liable to stand idle for a long period.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Care of Open Circuit Batteries.</span></h3>

<p><em>Terminals.</em>&mdash;Take care that the solutions
do not splash over terminals; keep all terminals
and binding post screws clean and bright.
See that all wires are tightly clamped in
terminals, also that their ends are clean. A
loose contact is productive of infinite trouble.
Examine connections that elements are in
proper relation to each other. If in multiple,
to produce large current&mdash;zincs together and
carbons together. If in series, for high
electromotive force&mdash;zinc to carbon, throughout
battery.</p>

<p><em>Zincs.</em>&mdash;See that the zincs are clean; if crystals
form, either reduce strength of solution
with water, or scrape zincs clean, and watch if
repeated. Examine screw which holds wire;
it often corrodes, and makes poor contact in
the thread.</p>

<p>A clever device for preserving a rod zinc
from the accumulation of crystals is made by
the manufacturers of the Samson cell. It consists
of a thin paper tube which is slipped
over the zinc. When the crystals accumulate
so as to impair the cell, the tube is slipped off
and a new one put on. This device increases<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the internal resistance of the cell but very
slightly.</p>

<p><em>Porous cups and carbons.</em>&mdash;Wash in warm
water. Carbons can be well soaked in warm
water and dried in <em>sun</em>, in a place where they
will not accumulate dust. Porous cups should
be well soaked in warm water, and left to
drain in a place exposed to dustless air.
Examine binding post holes and screws.</p>

<p><em>Solutions.</em>&mdash;Do not make too strong. Use
not more than six ounces, or more than four
ounces avoirdupois, of chemically pure sal
ammoniac to one cell Leclanche. Warm
water can be used for making solutions, if
desired. Some persons drop a teaspoonful of
acetic acid in the cell; it is not recommended.
If in a place where sal ammoniac cannot be
procured, use temporarily common table-salt
in same proportion; thoroughly well clean
battery first.</p>

<p>Batteries should be kept in a cool dry place.
Dry cells should stand upright, also in a cool
place, and an examination made once in a
while of the connections.</p>

J. H. CROMWELL.</p>

<p>ITS GOOD POINTS.</p>

<p>Very easy to learn.</p>

<p>A rapid method to become a good letterer with a
little practice.</p>

<p>Very easy to lay out a line of words in <span class="smcap">Strict
Proportion</span>, whether it be on a fence 500 yards long
or on a drawing only a few inches across.</p>

<p>Good for draughtsmen who prefer neat lettering,
yet something out of the ordinary.</p>

<p>It contains 26 pages of alphabets whose modifications
are almost limitless.</p>

<p>One of the cheapest in the market.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This little book will be appreciated by draughtsmen who wish to
use plain letters (and yet somewhat different from the ordinary run of
letters) for the titles on drawings. The book will also be valuable
and useful to any one who has had no practice in lettering, as the
easy method given for forming the letters will enable a person to
form the letters correctly, and with a little practice to do so quickly.&mdash;<em>American
Machinist.</em></p></blockquote>
